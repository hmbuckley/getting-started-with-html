<body>The world wide web is made up of HTML documents(Hyper text markup language).<br>
It uses hyperlinks or links to glue it all together. It was created in the early 90s.<br>

The major pieces of the web are:<br>

<b>You</b>, your computer and your web browser,
the internet,
and the servers that sit in wiring closets<br>
 and host all of the different types of files, such as images, videos, documents etc

<p> The web uses <b>HTTP(Hyper Text Transport Protocol)</b></p>
<em>HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is used to create web pages.</em>
<p> HTML Markup uses elements that are made up of tags, content and attributes</p>
There are many differnt types of tags such as b for bold, em for italics, br for line break<br>
and p for paragraph.
<p> You can insert links to other pages such as <a href "nhl.com"> hockey</a> to get the latest on the nhl.</p>
Attributes have values such as nhl.com in the link above.<br>
All whitespace becomes a single line, so you can use br or p to create new lines and paragraphs.
